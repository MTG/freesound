## Development

Freesound is composed of a number of different services which can be run and orchestrated using Docker. The main service is provided by the `web` container which runs the Freesound Django application. Check out [this blog post](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/entries/freesound-intro/) for some information about the Freesound technology stack. If you're going to do development on Freesound, please check the [DEVELOPERS](https://github.com/MTG/freesound/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md) file for some guidelines.

Below are instructions for setting up a local Freesound installation for development. It is assumed that you have a working Docker installation.


### Setting up Freesound for development in just 13 easy steps :-

1. Clone source code repository
    
       git clone git@github.com:MTG/freesound.git
       cd freesound

2. Create a directory named `freesound-data` inside the repository folder

       mkdir freesound-data

3. Download the [Freesound development data zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ih3or14n-pRVZ-oB0KThp4VVEiKhAeUK/view?usp=sharing) (~20GB) and uncompress it inside `freesound-data`. You should get permission to download this file from Freesound admins. File structure should look like this:

       freesound/
       freesound/freesound-data/
       freesound/freesound-data/analysis/
       freesound/freesound-data/avatar/
       ...

4. Download [Freesound development similarity index](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ydJUUXbQZbHrva4UZd3C05wDcOXI7v1m/view?usp=sharing) and the [Freesound tag recommendation models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1snaktMysCXdThWKkYuKWoGc_Hk2BElmz/view?usp=sharing) and place their contents under `freesound-data/similarity_index/` and `freesound-data/tag_recommendation_models` directories respectively (you'll need to create the directories). You should get permission to download these files from Freesound admins.

5. Rename `freesound/local_settings.example.py` file so you can customise Django settings if needed and create a `.env` file with your local user UID

       cp freesound/local_settings.example.py freesound/local_settings.py
       echo FS_USER_ID_FROM_ENV=$(id -u) > .env

6. [Optional] Create API credentials for the 3rd party services listed below and add them to your own `freesound/local_settings.py` file (check `settings.py` to know the config parameter names that you need to fill in):

   * Mapbox
   * Recaptcha 

7. Build the base Freesound Docker image

       make -C docker

8. Build all Docker containers. The first time you run this command can take a while as a number of Docker images need to be downloaded and things need to be installed and compiled. 

       docker-compose build

9. Download the [Freesound development database dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8_0Sa6J5tDQ3k4kvBp4zLUDuYKPUjnq/view?usp=sharing) (~50MB), run the database container and load the data into it. You should get permission to download this file from Freesound admins.

       docker-compose up -d db
       cat /path/to/freesound/development/db/dump.sql | docker-compose run --rm db psql -h db -U freesound  -d freesound

10. Update database by running Django migrations

        docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate

11. Create a superuser account to be able to login to the local Freesound website and to the admin site

        docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser

12. Run all services ðŸŽ‰ 

        docker-compose up

  This might take significant time as many services will be started at once. When done, you should be able to point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` and see the Freesound website up and running!


13. Build the search index so you can, well, search

        # Open a new terminal window so the services started in the previous step keep running
        docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py reindex_solr
        docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py reindex_solr_forum

After following the steps you'll have a fully functional Freesound installation up and running, including the search, sound similarity and audio processing features (and more!). As a sort of *bonus step*, you can run Django's shell plus command like this:

    docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py shell_plus

Because the `web` container mounts a named volume for the home folder of the user running the shell plus process, command history should be kept between container runs :)

In most situations it is possible that not all Freesound services need to be running. You can selectively run services using the `docker-compose` interface and this will speed up the startup time. For example, the most common service you'll need for development will be the `web` container and (maybe) `search`. Then you can do:

    docker-compose up web search


### Running tests

You can run tests using the Django test runner in the `web` container like that:

    docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py test --settings=freesound.test_settings
