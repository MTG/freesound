Freesound API documentation
===========================

Welcome to the Freesound API docs!

With the **Freesound API** you can browse, search, and retrieve information
about Freesound users, packs, and the sounds themselves of course. You
can find similar sounds to a given target (based on content analysis)
and retrieve automatically extracted features from audio files, as well as perform
advanced queries combining content analysis features and other metadata (tags, etc...).
With the Freesound API, you can also upload, comment, rate and bookmark sounds!

**NOTE**: The documentation that you'll find in this page corresponds to the **Freesound APIv2**.
The previous version of the API, Freesound APIv1, has reached its end of life and is no longer available.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to post them in our
mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/freesound-api.
