.. _sound-text-search-parameters:

Request parameters (text search parameters)
-------------------------------------------

Text search queries are defined using the following request parameters:

======================  =========================  ======================
Name                    Type                       Description
======================  =========================  ======================
``query``               string                     The query! The ``query`` is the main parameter used to define a query. You can type several terms separated by spaces or phrases wrapped inside quote '"' characters. For every term, you can also use '+' and '-' modifier characters to indicate that a term is "mandatory" or "prohibited" (by default, terms are considered to be "mandatory"). For example, in a query such as ``query=term_a -term_b``, sounds including ``term_b`` will not match the search criteria. The query does a weighted search over some sound properties including sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound id. Therefore, searching for ``query=123`` will find you sounds with id 1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc. You'll find some examples below. Using an empty query (``query=`` or ``query=""``) will return all Freeosund sounds.
``filter``              string                     Allows filtering query results. See below for more information.
``sort``                string                     Indicates how query results should be sorted. See below for a list of the sorting options. By default ``sort=score``.
``group_by_pack``       bool (yes=1, no=0)         This parameter represents a boolean option to indicate whether to collapse results belonging to sounds of the same pack into single entries in the results list. If ``group_by_pack=1`` and search results contain more than one sound that belongs to the same pack, only one sound for each distinct pack is returned (sounds with no packs are returned as well). However, the returned sound will feature two extra properties to access these other sounds omitted from the results list: ``n_from_same_pack``: indicates how many other results belong to the same pack (and have not been returned) ``more_from_same_pack``: uri pointing to the list of omitted sound results of the same pack (also including the result which has already been returned). See examples below. By default ``group_by_pack=0``.
======================  =========================  ======================


**The 'filter' parameter**

Search results can be filtered by specifying a series of properties that sounds should match.
In other words, using the ``filter`` parameter you can specify the value that certain sound fields should have in order to be considered valid search results.
Filters are defined with a syntax like ``filter=fieldname:value fieldname:value`` (that is the Solr filter syntax).
Use double quotes for multi-word queries (``filter=fieldname:"val ue"``).
Field names can be any of the following:


======================  ====================================================
id		        integer, sound id on freesound
username: 		string, not tokenized
created: 		date
original_filename: 	string, tokenized
description: 		string, tokenized
tag: 			string
license: 		string ("Attribution", "Attribution Noncommercial" or "Creative Commons 0")
is_remix: 		boolean
was_remixed: 		boolean
pack: 			string
pack_tokenized: 	string, tokenized
is_geotagged: 		boolean
type: 			string, original file type ("wav", "aif", "aiff", "ogg", "mp3", "m4a" or "flac")
duration: 		numerical, duration of sound in seconds
bitdepth: 		integer, WARNING is not to be trusted right now
bitrate: 		numerical, WARNING is not to be trusted right now
samplerate: 		integer
filesize: 		integer, file size in bytes
channels: 		integer, number of channels in sound (mostly 1 or 2)
md5: 			string, 32-byte md5 hash of file
num_downloads: 		integer
avg_rating: 		numerical, average rating, from 0 to 5
num_ratings: 		integer, number of ratings
comment: 		string, tokenized (filter is satisfied if sound contains the specified value in at least one of its comments)
comments: 		numerical, number of comments
======================  ====================================================

For numeric or integer filters, a range can also be specified using the following syntax (the "TO" needs
to be upper case!)::

  filter=fieldname:[start TO end]
  filter=fieldname:[* TO end]
  filter=fieldname:[start to \*]

Dates can have ranges (and math) too (the "TO" needs to be upper case!)::

  filter=created:[* TO NOW]
  filter=created:[1976-03-06T23:59:59.999Z TO *]
  filter=created:[1995-12-31T23:59:59.999Z TO 2007-03-06T00:00:00Z]
  filter=created:[NOW-1YEAR/DAY TO NOW/DAY+1DAY]
  filter=created:[1976-03-06T23:59:59.999Z TO 1976-03-06T23:59:59.999Z+1YEAR]
  filter=created:[1976-03-06T23:59:59.999Z/YEAR TO 1976-03-06T23:59:59.999Z]

Simple logic operators can also be used in filters::

  filter=type:(wav OR aiff)
  filter=description:(piano AND note)

See below for some examples!


**The 'sort' parameter**

The ``sort`` parameter determines how the results are sorted, and can only be one
of the following.

==============  ====================================================================
Option          Explanation
==============  ====================================================================
score           Sort by a relevance score returned by our search engine (default).
duration_desc   Sort by the duration of the sounds, longest sounds first.
duration_asc    Same as above, but shortest sounds first.
created_desc    Sort by the date of when the sound was added. newest sounds first.
created_asc	    Same as above, but oldest sounds first.
downloads_desc  Sort by the number of downloads, most downloaded sounds first.
downloads_asc   Same as above, but least downloaded sounds first.
rating_desc     Sort by the average rating given to the sounds, highest rated first.
rating_asc      Same as above, but lowest rated sounds first.
==============  ====================================================================


**Filter queries using geotagging data**

Text-based search also supports filtering query results using geotagging data.
For example, you can retrieve sounds that were recorded near a particular location or filter the results of a query to those sounds recorded in a geospatial area.
Note that not all sounds in Freesound are geotagged, and the results of such queries will only include geotagged sounds.
In general, you can define geotagging queries in two ways:

 1) By specifying a point in space and a maximum distance: this way lets you specify a latitude and longitude target point,
 and a maximum distance (in km) from that point. Query results will only include those points contained in the area.
 You can use the ``filter`` parameter of a standard query to specify latitude, longitude and maximum distance using the
 following syntax::

  filter={!geofilt sfield=geotag pt=<LATITUDE>,<LONGITUDE> d=<MAX_DISTANCE_IN_KM>}


 2) By specifying an arbirtrary rectangle in space: this way lets you define a rectangle in space by specifying a
 minimum latitude and longitude, and a maximum latitude and longitude.
 Query results will only include those points contained in the area.
 You can use the ``filter`` parameter of a standard query to specify minimum and maximum latitude and longitude using the
 following syntax::

  filter=geotag:"Intersects(<MINIMUM_LONGITUDE> <MINIMUM_LATITUDE> <MAXIMUM_LONGITUDE> <MAXIMUM_LATITUDE>)"


 Minimum and maximum latitude and longitude define the lower left and upper right corners of the rectangle as shown below.
 Besides ``Intersects`` you can also use ``IsDisjointTo``, which will return all sounds geotagged outside the rectangle.

        :align: center


Please refer to the Solr docummentation on spatial queries for extra information (http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrAdaptersForLuceneSpatial4) and check the examples below.


.. _sound-list-response:

Response (sound list)
---------------------

Search resource returns a *sound list response*. Sound list responses have the following structure:

::

  {
    "count": <total number of results>,
    "next": <link to the next page of results (null if none)>,
    "results": [
        <sound result #1 info>,
        <sound result #2 info>,
        ...
        <sound result #page_size info>
    ],
    "previous": <link to the previous page of results (null if none)>
  }


There are some extra request parameters that you can use to determine some of the contents of the sound list response.
These parameters are ``page`` and ``page_size`` (to deal with pagination), and ``fields``, ``descriptors`` and ``normalized`` to deal with the sound information that is returned for every sound in the results.

======================  =========================  ======================
Name                    Type                       Description
======================  =========================  ======================
``page``                string                     Query results are paginated, this parameter indicates what page should be returned. By default ``page=1``.
``page_size``           string                     Indicates the number of sounds per page to include in the result. By default ``page_size=15``, and the maximum is ``page_size=150``. Not that with bigger ``page_size``, more data will need to be transferred.
``fields``              comma separated strings    Indicates which sound properties should be included in every sound of the response. Sound properties can be any of those listed in :ref:`sound-instance-response`, and must be separated by commas. For example, if ``fields=name,avg_rating,license``, results will include sound name, average rating and license for every returned sound. **Use this parameter to optimize request times by only requesting the information you really need**.
``descriptors``         comma separated strings    Indicates which sound content-based descriptors should be included in every sound of the response. **This parameter will have no effect if** ``analysis`` **property is not included in the** ``fields`` **request parameter**. Descriptor names can be any of those listed in :ref:`available-descriptors`, and must be separated by commas. For example, if ``fields=analysis&descriptors=lowlevel.spectral_centroid,lowlevel.barkbands.mean``, the response will include, for every returned sound, all statistics of the spectral centroid descriptor and the mean of the barkbands. Descriptor values are included in the response inside the ``analysis`` sound property (see the examples). ``analysis`` might be null if no valid descriptor names are found or the analysis data of a particular sound is not available.
``normalized``          bool (yes=1, no=0)         Indicates whether the returned sound content-based descriptors should be normalized or not. ``normalized=1`` will return normalized descriptor values. By default, ``normalized=0``.
======================  =========================  ======================

If ``fields``  is not specified, a minimal set of information for every sound result is returned by default.
This includes the id of the sound, the name and tags of the sound, the username of the user that uploaded the sound and the license
(i.e. by default ``fields=id,name,tags,username,license``).

.. _sound-content-search:

Content Search
=========================================================

::

  GET /apiv2/search/content/
  POST /apiv2/search/content/

This resource allows searching sounds in Freesound based on their content descriptors.


.. _sound-content-search-parameters:

Request parameters (content search parameters)
----------------------------------------------

Content search queries are defined using the following request parameters:

=========================  =========================  ======================
Name                       Type                       Description
=========================  =========================  ======================
``target``                 string or number           This parameter defines a target based on content-based descriptors to sort the search results. It can be set as a number of descriptor name and value pairs, or as a sound id. See below.
``analysis_file``          file                       Alternatively, targets can be specified by uploading a file with the output of the Essentia Freesound Extractor analysis of any sound that you analized locally (see below). This parameter overrides ``target``, and requires the use of POST method.
``descriptors_filter``      string                     This parameter allows filtering query results by values of the content-based descriptors. See below for more information.
=========================  =========================  ======================

**The 'target' and 'analysis_file' parameters**

The ``target`` parameter can be used to specify a content-based sorting of your search results.
Using ``target`` you can sort the query results so that the first results will be the sounds featuring the most similar descriptors to the given target.
To specify a target you must use a syntax like ``target=descriptor_name:value``.
You can also set multiple descriptor/value paris in a target separating them with spaces (``target=descriptor_name:value descriptor_name:value``).
Descriptor names must be chosen from those listed in :ref:`available-descriptors`. Only numerical descriptors are allowed.
Multidimensional descriptors with fixed-length (that always have the same number of dimensions) are allowed too (see below).
Consider the following two ``target`` examples::

  (A) target=lowlevel.pitch.mean:220
  (B) target=lowlevel.pitch.mean:220 lowlevel.pitch.var:0

Example A will sort the query results so that the first results will have a mean pitch as close to 220Hz as possible.
Example B will sort the query results so that the first results will have a mean pitch as close to 220Hz as possible and a pitch variance as close as possible to 0.
In that case example B will promote sounds that have a steady pitch close to 220Hz.

Multidimensional descriptors can also be used in the ``target`` parameter::

  target=sfx.tristimulus.mean:0,1,0

Alternatively, ``target`` can also be set to point to a Freesound sound.
In that case the descriptors of the sound will be used as the target for the query, therefore query results will be sorted according to their similarity to the targeted sound.
To set a sound as a target of the query you must use the sound id. For example, to use sound with id 1234 as target::

  target=1234


There is even another way to specify a target for the query, which is by uploading an analysis file generated using the Essentia Freesound Extractor.
For doing that you will need to download and compile Essentia (we recommend using release 2.0.1), an open source feature extraction library developed at the Music Technology Group (https://github.com/mtg/essentia/tree/2.0.1),
and use the 'streaming_extractor_freesound' example to analyze any sound you have in your local computer.
As a result, the extractor will create a JSON file that you can use as target in your Freesound API content search queries.
To use this file as target you will need to use the POST method (instead of GET) and attach the file as an ``analysis_file`` POST parameter (see example below).
Setting the target as an ``analysis_file`` allows you to to find sounds in Freesound that are similar to any other sound that you have in your local computer and that it is not part of Freesound.
When using ``analysis_file``, the contents of ``target`` are ignored.

Note that if ``target`` (or ``analysis_file``) is not used in combination with ``descriptors_filter``, the results of the query will
include all sounds from Freesound indexed in the similarity server, sorted by similarity to the target.


**The 'descriptors_filter' parameter**

The ``descriptors_filter`` parameter is used to restrict the query results to those sounds whose content descriptor values match with the defined filter.
To define ``descriptors_filter`` parameter you can use the same syntax as for the normal ``filter`` parameter, including numeric ranges and simple logic operators.
For example, ``descriptors_filter=lowlevel.pitch.mean:220`` will only return sounds that have an EXACT pitch mean of 220hz.
Note that this would probably return no results as a sound will rarely have that exact pitch (might be very close like 219.999 or 220.000001 but not exactly 220).
For this reason, in general it might be better to indicate ``descriptors_filter`` using ranges.
Descriptor names must be chosen from those listed in :ref:`available-descriptors`.
Note that most of the descriptors provide several statistics (var, mean, min, max...). In that case, the descriptor name must include also the desired statistic (see examples below).
Non fixed-length descriptors are not allowed.
Some examples of ``descriptors_filter`` for numerical descriptors::

  descriptors_filter=lowlevel.pitch.mean:[219.9 TO 220.1]
  descriptors_filter=lowlevel.pitch.mean:[219.9 TO 220.1] AND lowlevel.pitch_salience.mean:[0.6 TO *]
  descriptors_filter=lowlevel.mfcc.mean[0]:[-1124 TO -1121]
  descriptors_filter=lowlevel.mfcc.mean[1]:[17 TO 20] AND lowlevel.mfcc.mean[4]:[0 TO 20]

Note how in the last two examples the filter operates in a particular dimension of a multidimensional descriptor (with dimension index starting at 0).

``descriptors_filter`` can also be defined using non numerical descriptors such as 'tonal.key_key' or 'tonal.key_scale'.
In that case, the value must be enclosed in double quotes '"', and the character '#' (for example for an A# key) must be indicated with the string 'sharp'.
Non numerical descriptors can not be indicated using ranges.
For example::

  descriptors_filter=tonal.key_key:"Asharp"
  descriptors_filter=tonal.key_scale:"major"
  descriptors_filter=(tonal.key_key:"C" AND tonal.key_scale:"major") OR (tonal.key_key:"A" AND tonal.key_scale:"minor")

You can combine both numerical and non numerical descriptors as well::

  descriptors_filter=tonal.key_key:"C" tonal.key_scale="major" tonal.key_strength:[0.8 TO *]




Response
--------

The Content Search resource returns a sound list just like :ref:`sound-list-response`.
The same extra request parameters apply (``page``, ``page_size``, ``fields``, ``descriptors`` and ``normalized``).

.. _sound-combined-search:

Combined Search
=========================================================

::

  GET /apiv2/search/combined/
  POST /apiv2/search/combined/

This resource is a combination of :ref:`sound-text-search` and :ref:`sound-content-search`, and allows searching sounds in Freesound based on their tags, metadata and content-based descriptors.


Request parameters
------------------

Combined Search request parameters can include any of the parameters from text-based search queries (``query``, ``filter`` and ``sort``, :ref:`sound-text-search-parameters`)
and content-based search queries (``target``, ``analysis_file`` and ``descriptors_filter`` and, :ref:`sound-content-search-parameters`).
Note that ``group_by_pack`` **is not** available in combined search queries.

In Combined Search, queries can be defined both like a standard textual query or as a target of content-descriptors, and
query results can be filtered by values of sounds' metadata and sounds' content-descriptors... all at once!

To perform a Combined Search query you must at least specify a ``query`` or a ``target`` parameter (as you would do in text-based and content-based searches respectively),
and at least one text-based or content-based filter (``filter`` and ``descriptors_filter``).
Request parameters ``query`` and ``target`` can not be used at the same time, but ``filter`` and ``descriptors_filter`` can both be present in a single Combined Search query.
In any case, you must always use at least one text-based search request parameter and one content-based search request parameter.
Note that ``sort`` parameter must always be accompanied by a ``query`` or ``filter`` parameter (or both), otherwise it is ignored.
``sort`` parameter will also be ignored if parameter ``target`` (or ``analysis_file``) is present in the query.

Combined Search requests might **require significant computational resources** on our servers depending on the particular
query that is made. Therefore, responses might take longer than usual. Fortunately, response times can vary a lot
with some small modifications in the query, and this is in your hands ;).
As a general rule, we recommend not to use the text-search parameter ``query``, and instead define metadata stuff in a ``filter``.
For example, instead of setting the parameter ``query=loop``, try filtering results to sounds that have the tag loop (``filter=tag:loop``).
Furthermore, you can try narrowing down your filter or filters (``filter`` and ``descriptors_filter``) and possibly make the queries faster.
Best response times are normally obtained by specifying a content-based ``target`` in combination with text-based and
content-based filters (``filter`` and ``descriptors_filter``).



Response
--------

The Combined Search resource **returns a variation** of the standard sound list response :ref:`sound-list-response`.
Combined Search responses are dictionaries with the following structure:

::

  {
    "results": [
        <sound result #1 info>,
        <sound result #2 info>,
        ...
    ],
    "more": <link to get more results (null if there are no more results)>,
  }

The ``results`` field will include a list of sounds just like in the normal sound list response.
The length of this list can be defined using the ``page_size`` request parameter like in normal sound list responses.
However, Combined Search responses **do not guarantee** that the number of elements inside ``results`` will be equal to
the number specified in ``page_size``. In some cases, you might find less results, so **you should verify the length of the list**.

Furthermore, instead of the ``next`` and ``previous`` links to navigate among results, Combined Search responses
only offer a ``more`` link that you can use to obtain more results. You can think of the ``more`` link as a
rough equivalent to ``next``, but it does not work by indicating page numbers as in normal sound list responses.

Also, note that ``count`` field is not present in the Combined Search response, therefore you do not know in advance the total
amount of results that a query can return.

Finally, Combined Search responses does allow you to use the ``fields``, ``descriptors`` and ``normalized``
parameters just like you would do in standard sound list responses.

``analysis_frames``   URI               The URI for retrieving a JSON file with analysis information for each frame of the sound (see :ref:`analysis-docs`).
====================  ================  ====================================================================================


The contents of the field ``analysis`` of the Sound Instance response can be determined using an additional request parameter ``descriptors``.
The ``descriptors`` parameter should include a comma separated list of content-based descriptor names, just like in the :ref:`sound-list-response`.
Descriptor names can be any of those listed in :ref:`available-descriptors` (e.g. ``descriptors=lowlevel.mfcc,rhythm.bpm``).
The request parameter ``normalized`` can also be used to return content-based descriptor values in a normalized range instead of the absolute values.

The parameter ``fields`` can also be used to restrict the number of fields returned in the response.

Sound Analysis
=========================================================

::

  GET /apiv2/sounds/<sound_id>/analysis/

This resource allows the retrieval of analysis information (content-based descriptors) of a sound.
Although content-based descriptors can also be retrieved using the ``descriptors`` request parameter in any API resource that returns sound lists or with the :ref:`sound-sound` resource,
using the Sound Analysis resource you can retrieve **all sound descriptors** at once.


Response
--------

The response to a Sound Analysis request is a dictionary with the values of all content-based descriptors listed in :ref:`analysis-docs`.
That dictionary can be filtered using an extra ``descriptors`` request parameter which should include a list of comma separated descriptor names chosen from those listed in :ref:`available-descriptors` (e.g. ``descriptors=lowlevel.mfcc,rhythm.bpm``).
The request parameter ``normalized`` can also be used to return content-based descriptor values in a normalized range instead of the absolute values.


Examples
--------

Similar Sounds
=========================================================

::

  GET /apiv2/sounds/<sound_id>/similar/

This resource allows the retrieval of sounds similar to the given sound target.


Request parameters
------------------

Essentially, the Similar Sounds resource is like a :ref:`sound-content-search` resource with the parameter ``target`` fixed to the sound id indicated in the url.
You can still use the ``descriptors_filter`` request parameter to restrict the query results to those sounds whose content descriptor values comply with the defined filter.
Use ``descriptors_filter`` in the same way as in :ref:`sound-content-search`.



Response
--------

Similar Sounds resource returns a sound list just like :ref:`sound-list-response`.
The same extra request parameters apply (``page``, ``page_size``, ``fields``, ``descriptors`` and ``normalized``).


Examples
--------

Sound Comments
=========================================================

::

  GET /apiv2/sounds/<sound_id>/comments/

This resource allows the retrieval of the comments of a sound.


Response
--------

Sound Comments resource returns a paginated list of the comments of a sound, with a similar structure as :ref:`sound-list-response`:

::

  {
    "count": <total number of comments>,
    "next": <link to the next page of comments (null if none)>,
    "results": [
        <most recent comment for sound_id>,
        <second most recent comment for sound_id>,
        ...
    ],
    "previous": <link to the previous page of comments (null if none)>
  }

Comments are sorted according to their creation date (recent comments in the top of the list).
Parameters ``page`` and ``page_size`` can be used just like in :ref:`sound-list-response` to deal with the pagination of the response.

Each comment entry consists of a dictionary with the following structure:

::

  {
    "username": <username of the user who made the comment>
    "comment": <the comment itself>,
    "created": <the date when the comment was made, e.g. "2014-03-15T14:06:48.022">
  }

.. _sound-download:

Download Sound (OAuth2 required)
=========================================================

::

  GET /apiv2/sounds/<sound_id>/download/

This resource allows you to download a sound in its original format/quality (the format/quality with which the sound was uploaded).
It requires :ref:`oauth-authentication`.

Examples
--------

{{examples_DownloadSound}}


.. _sound-upload:

Upload Sound (OAuth2 required)
=========================================================

::

  POST /apiv2/sounds/upload/

This resource allows you to upload an audio file into Freesound and (optionally) describe it.
If no file description is provided (see below), only the audio file will be uploaded and you will need to describe it later using the :ref:`sound-describe` resource.
If the file description is also provided, the uploaded file will be ready for the processing and moderation stage.
A list of uploaded files pending description, processing or moderation can be obtained using the :ref:`sound-pending-uploads` resource.

The author of the uploaded sound will be the user authenticated via OAuth2, therefore this method requires :ref:`oauth-authentication`.


Request parameters
------------------

The uploaded audio file must be attached to the request as an ``audiofile`` POST parameter.
Supported file formats include .wav, .aif, .flac, .ogg and .mp3.

Additionally, the request can include the following POST parameters to provide a description for the file:

====================  ================  ====================================================================================
Name                  Type              Description
====================  ================  ====================================================================================
``name``              string            (OPTIONAL) The name that will be given to the sound. If not provided, filename will be used.
``tags``              string            The tags that will be assigned to the sound. Separate tags with spaces and join multi-words with dashes (e.g. "tag1 tag2 tag3 cool-tag4").
``description``       string            A textual description of the sound.
``license``           string            The license of the sound. Must be either "Attribution", "Attribution Noncommercial" or "Creative Commons 0".
``pack``              string            (OPTIONAL) The name of the pack where the sound should be included. If user has created no such pack with that name, a new one will be created.
``geotag``            string            (OPTIONAL) Geotag information for the sound. Latitude, longitude and zoom values in the form lat,lon,zoom (e.g. "2.145677,3.22345,14").
====================  ================  ====================================================================================

Note that ``tags``, ``description`` and ``license`` parameters are REQUIRED when providing a description for the file, but can be omitted if no description is provided.
In other words, you can either only provide the ``audiofile`` parameter, or provide ``audiofile`` plus ``tags``, ``description``, ``license`` and any of the other optional parameters.
In the first case, a file will be uploaded but not described (you will need to describe it later), and in the second case a file will both be uploaded and described.


Response
--------

If file description was provided, on successful upload, the Upload Sound resource will return a dictionary with the following structure:

::

  {
    "detail": "Audio file successfully uploaded and described (now pending processing and moderation)",
    "id": "<sound_id for the uploaded and described sound instance>"
  }

Note that after the sound is uploaded and described, it still needs to be processed and moderated by the team of Freesound moderators.
Therefore, **accessing the Sound Instance using the returned ``id`` will lead to a 404 Not Found error until the sound is approved by the moderators**.
If some of the required fields are missing or some of the provided fields are badly formatted, a 400 Bad Request response will be returned with a ``detail`` field describing the errors.

If file description was NOT provided, on successful upload, the Upload Sound resource will return a dictionary with the following structure:

::

  {
    "detail": "Audio file successfully uploaded (<file size>, now pending description)",
    "filename": "<filename of the uploaded audio file>"
  }

In that case, you will probably want to store the content of the ``filename`` field because
it will be needed to later describe the sound using the :ref:`sound-describe` resource.
Alternatively, you can retrieve later a the filenames of uploads pending description using the :ref:`sound-pending-uploads` resource.


Examples
--------

{{examples_UploadSound}}


.. _sound-describe:

Describe Sound (OAuth2 required)
=========================================================

::

  POST /apiv2/sounds/describe/

This resource allows you to describe a previously uploaded audio file that has not yet been described.
This method requires :ref:`oauth-authentication`.
Note that after a sound is described, it still needs to be processed and moderated by the team of Freesound moderators, therefore it will not yet appear in Freesound.
You can obtain a list of sounds uploaded and described by the user logged in using OAuth2 but still pending processing and moderation using the :ref:`sound-pending-uploads` resource.


Request parameters
------------------

A request to the Describe Sound resource must include the following POST parameters:

====================  ================  ====================================================================================
Name                  Type              Description
====================  ================  ====================================================================================
``upload_filename``   string            The filename of the sound to describe. Must match with one of the filenames returned in :ref:`sound-pending-uploads` resource.
``name``              string            (OPTIONAL) The name that will be given to the sound. If not provided, filename will be used.
``tags``              string            The tags that will be assigned to the sound. Separate tags with spaces and join multi-words with dashes (e.g. "tag1 tag2 tag3 cool-tag4").
``description``       string            A textual description of the sound.
``license``           string            The license of the sound. Must be either "Attribution", "Attribution Noncommercial" or "Creative Commons 0".
``pack``              string            (OPTIONAL) The name of the pack where the sound should be included. If user has created no such pack with that name, a new one will be created.
``geotag``            string            (OPTIONAL) Geotag information for the sound. Latitude, longitude and zoom values in the form lat,lon,zoom (e.g. "2.145677,3.22345,14").
====================  ================  ====================================================================================


Response
--------

If the audio file is described successfully, the Describe Sound resource will return a dictionary with the following structure:

::

  {
    "detail": "Sound successfully described (now pending processing and moderation)",
    "id": "<sound_id for the uploaded and described sound instance>"
  }

Note that after the sound is described, it still needs to be processed and moderated by the team of Freesound moderators.
Therefore, **accessing the Sound Instance using the returned ``id`` will lead to a 404 Not Found error until the sound is approved by the moderators**.

If some of the required fields are missing or some of the provided fields are badly formatted, a 400 Bad Request response will be returned with a ``detail`` field describing the errors.


Examples
--------

{{examples_DescribeSound}}


.. _sound-pending-uploads:

Pending Uploads (OAuth2 required)
=========================================================

::

  GET /apiv2/sounds/pending_uploads/

This resource allows you to retrieve a list of audio files uploaded by the Freesound user logged in using OAuth2 that have not yet been described, processed or moderated.
In Fressound, when sounds are uploaded they first need to be described by their uploaders.
After the description step, sounds are automatically processed and then enter the moderation phase, where a team of human moderators either accepts or rejects the upload.
Using this resource, your application can keep track of user uploads status in Freesound.
This method requires :ref:`oauth-authentication`.


Response
--------

The Pending Uploads resource returns a dictionary with the following structure:

::

  {
    "pending_description": [
        "<filename #1>",
        "<filename #2>",
        ...
    ],
    "pending_processing": [
        <sound #1>,
        <sound #2>,
        ...
    ],
    "pending_moderation": [
        <sound #1>,
        <sound #2>,
        ...
    ],
  }

The filenames returned under "pending_description" field are used as file identifiers in the :ref:`sound-describe` resource.
Each sound entry either under "pending_processing" or "pending_moderation" fields consists of a minimal set
of information about that sound including the ``id``, ``name``, ``tags``, ``description``, ``created`` and ``license`` fields
that you would find in a :ref:`sound-instance-response`.

Sounds under "pending_processing" contain an extra ``processing_state`` field that indicates the status of the sound in the
processing step. Processing is done automatically in Freesound right after sounds are described, and it normally takes less than a minute.
Therefore, you should normally see that the list of sounds under "pending_processing" is empty. However, if there are
errors during processing, uploaded sounds will remain in this category exhibiting a ``processing_state`` equal to ``Failed``.

Sounds under "pending_moderation" also contain an extra ``images`` field containing the uris of the waveform and spectrogram
images of the sound as described in :ref:`sound-instance-response`.


Examples
--------

{{examples_PendingUploads}}


.. _sound-edit-description:

Edit Sound Description (OAuth2 required)
=========================================================

::

  POST /apiv2/sounds/<sound_id>/edit/

This resource allows you to edit the description of an already existing sound.
Note that this resource can only be used to edit descriptions of sounds created by the Freesound user logged in using OAuth2.
This method requires :ref:`oauth-authentication`.


Request parameters
------------------

A request to the Edit Sound Description resource must include mostly the same POST parameters that would be included in a :ref:`sound-describe` request:

====================  ================  ====================================================================================
Name                  Type              Description
====================  ================  ====================================================================================
``name``              string            (OPTIONAL) The new name that will be given to the sound.
``tags``              string            (OPTIONAL) The new tags that will be assigned to the sound. Note that if this parameter is filled, old tags will be deleted. Separate tags with spaces and join multi-words with dashes (e.g. "tag1 tag2 tag3 cool-tag4").
``description``       string            (OPTIONAL) The new textual description for the sound.
``license``           string            (OPTIONAL) The new license of the sound. Must be either "Attribution", "Attribution Noncommercial" or "Creative Commons 0".
``pack``              string            (OPTIONAL) The new name of the pack where the sound should be included. If user has created no such pack with that name, a new one will be created.
``geotag``            string            (OPTIONAL) New geotag information for the sound. Latitude, longitude and zoom values in the form lat,lon,zoom (e.g. "2.145677,3.22345,14").
====================  ================  ====================================================================================

Note that for that resource all parameters are optional.
Only the fields included in the request will be used to update the sound description
(e.g. if only ``name`` and ``tags`` are included in the request, these are the only properties that will be updated from sound description,
the others will remain unchanged).


Response
--------

If sound description is updated successfully, the Edit Sound Description resource will return a dictionary with a single ``detail`` field indicating that the sound has been successfully edited.
If some of the required fields are missing or some of the provided fields are badly formatted, a 400 Bad Request response will be returned with a ``detail`` field describing the errors.


Bookmark Sound (OAuth2 required)
=========================================================

::

  POST /apiv2/sounds/<sound_id>/bookmark/

This resource allows you to bookmark an existing sound.
The sound will be bookmarked by the Freesound user logged in using OAuth2, therefore this method requires :ref:`oauth-authentication`.


Request parameters

A request to the Rate Sound resource must only include a single POST parameter:

====================  ================  ====================================================================================
Name                  Type              Description
====================  ================  ====================================================================================
``rating``            integer           Integer between 0 and 5 (both included) representing the rating for the sound (i.e. 5 = maximum rating).
====================  ================  ====================================================================================


Response
--------

If the sound is successfully rated, the Rate Sound resource will return a dictionary with a single ``detail`` field indicating that the sound has been successfully rated.
If some of the required fields are missing or some of the provided fields are badly formatted, a 400 Bad Request response will be returned with a ``detail`` field describing the errors.
Note that in Freesound sounds can only be rated once by a single user. If attempting to rate a sound twice with the same user, a 409 Conflict response will be returned with a ``detail`` field indicating that user has already rated the sound.

Descriptors under the field ``fixed-length`` are those that can be used in content, combined and similarity searches.
They are divided among ``one-dimensional`` (descriptors that consist in a single value like spectral centroid or pitch)
and ``multi-dimensional`` (descriptors with several dimensions like mfcc or tristimulus).

Descriptors under the field ``variable-length`` may have different length depending on the sound, are can only be used
in the ``descriptors`` parameter of :ref:`sound-list-response`.

For more information check the :ref:`analysis-docs`.
