        Custom method for deleting a user from Freesound.

        Depending on the use case, users can be deleted completely from DB, or anonymized by removing their personal
        data but keeping related user generated content, etc. This method handles all of that and should be always
        used instead of User.delete().

        When deleting a user using Profile.delete_user(), a DeletedUser object will be always created to leave a
        trace of when was the user deleted and what was the reason. The original User object will be preserved but all
        the personal data will be anonymized, and the user will be flagged as having been deleted.

        When deleting a user, its sounds and packs can either be deleted or preserved (see function args description
        below). Other related content (ratings, comments, posts) will be preserved (but appear under a "deleted user"
        account).

        Optionally, a user can be fully deleted from DB including all of its packs, sounds and other related content.
        Even in this case a DeletedUser object will be created to keep a record.

        Args:
            remove_sounds (bool): if True the sounds created by the user will be deleted as well. Otherwise the sounds
              will still be available to other users but appear under a "deleted user" account. Defaults to False.
            delete_user_object_from_db (bool): if True the user object will be completely removed from the DB together
              with all related content. Defaults to False.
            deletion_reason (str): reason for the user being deleted. Should be one of the choices defined in
              DeletedUser.DELETION_REASON_CHOICES. Defaults to DeletedUser.DELETION_REASON_DELETED_BY_ADMIN.

    This model is used to store information about the process of deleting Freesound user accounts.
    This was designed to handle the case when a user requests to be deleted via email and we need to track the
    whole process for GDPR compliance. However, it is also used for users who decide to delete their accounts
    via the website form and for users deleted by Freesound admins. When a user requests to be deleted via email,
    we should manually create a UserDeletionRequest object using the Freesound admin interface and manage it
    from there. Once we actually call the delete function through the admin or through some other method, the status
    of this object will be automatically changed to 'User has been deleted or anonymized', and a DeletedUser
    object containing some information about the DeletedUser (for GDPR compliance) is also created and linked to this
    UserDeletionRequest request object. The UserDeletionRequest objects can be used in a management command
    to double check that users that should have been deleted/anonymized have in fact been deleted/anonymized.
    We can do that by making sure that all UserDeletionRequest with status 'Deletion action was triggered'
    have the UserDeletionRequest.user field set to null or pointing to a User object with
    User.profile.is_anonymized_user=True.
