# NOTE: The tag recommendation server needs some data files to be in the data folder
#
# For the class detection step:
#   Classifier.pkl              (precomputed classifier pickled)
#   Classifier_meta.json        (metadata of the classifier)
#   Classifier_TAG_NAMES.npy    (vector of all tag names used to train the classifier)
#
# Classifier files can be found in freesound-deploy repository.
#
# Having this classifier the recommendation server can be started. Once the server is running
# a command from the appservers must be run so the recommendation is feed with tag assignment data
# from freesound which is stored in a file called Index.json. This file incrementally stores
# all tag assignment information from freesound. Once this file exists and has some data, the
# "update_tagrecommendation_data.py" script can be run and will generate the following files:
# (if running in Docker environment, you can run the script like:
# docker compose run tagrecommendation  bash -c "cd /code; python update_tagrecommendation_data.py"
#
# For every class used:
#   [[DATABASE]]_[[CLASSNAME]]_SIMILARITY_MATRIX_cosine_SUBSET.npy
#   [[DATABASE]]_[[CLASSNAME]]_SIMILARITY_MATRIX_cosine_SUBSET_TAG_NAMES.npy
# Example:
#   FREESOUND2012_CFX_SIMILARITY_MATRIX_cosine_SUBSET.npy
#   FREESOUND2012_CFX_SIMILARITY_MATRIX_cosine_SUBSET_TAG_NAMES.npy
#   ...
#
# Once the files are generated, some remaining might be needed here and there and the recommendation system can be
# restarted. I know, this info is vague. Will be improved at some point :)
