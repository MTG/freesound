    <p>Hello dear Freesound user!</p>

    <p>We have recently updated our terms of service and privacy policy and we need you to give us your consent 
        before you can continue using Freesound. The updated terms of service and privacy policy are intended to <strong>
        clarify your rights as users, the ways in which we process your data</strong> and, in general, to protect you and us against 
        incorrect uses of the site. <strong>This update does not alter the Freesound philosophy in any way</strong>, 
        it is just a necessary step that we need to make in order to better comply with regulations such as the GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please, take some time to read our <a href="/help/tos_web/" target="_blank">terms of use</a> and
        the <a href="/help/privacy/" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. 
        We prepared a brief summary of them which we include here:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Uploaded sounds are released under one of the CC licenses you choose.
        Other content (metadata, tags, comments, etc...) is provided as CC-Zero.</li>
        <li>Your activity in Freesound is public and can be seen by all users (except your private messages).</li>
        <li>You are responsible for your posted content.</li>
        <li>We (Freesound) keep your data confidential and apply security measures to keep this confidentiality.</li>
        <li>We (Freesound) donâ€™t warrant that all the data on the site is correct.
            We are not liable for information not posted by us on this site.</li>
        <li>We (Freesound) may remove accounts of users that do not comply with the terms of use or who do not
            behave correctly (spam, offensive comments...).</li>
        <li>We can use anonymized data collected from Freesound (sounds, statistics about sounds, tags, comments, downloads...)
            for research purposes.</li>
        <li>You agree to receive email notifications in accordance with your email preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In addition to the update of terms of service and privacy policy, we also want to take this opportunity to <strong>upgrade current 
        Creative Commons licenses from 3.0 to 4.0</strong>. The main difference between these two is that Creative Commons licenses 4.0 are
        more user-friendly and more internationally robust, but the general terms are the same. More information can be found 
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/version4/" target="_blank">here</a>. The option to upgrade licenses is only offered to users
        who have uploaded sounds with any of the affected licenses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Below you'll find a box that you have to check in order to accept the updated terms and license change, and be able to continue using
        Freesound as usual. Thank you for your patience and understanding, we really appreciate the commitment
        of the Freesound community!!!
