                <b>{% bw_icon 'check' %}We are growing and need more resources</b>.
                    Freesound was <a href="https://freesound.org/help/about/" target="_blank">started in 2005</a>
                    at the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg" target="_blank">Music Technology Group</a>
                    and it has always been developed and maintained here.
                    We need your donations in order to be able to dedicate more resources to Freesound and not only
                    maintain it but also make it better: add new features, improve existing ones, etc.

                <b>{% bw_icon 'check' %}We don't like ads</b>.
                    Because of the nature of Freesound and the philosophy
                    of openness, sharing and reuse that we promote, we think that
                    the sustainability model that best fits our case
                    is one based on user donations like Wikipedia.

                <b>{% bw_icon 'check' %}It doesn't take a large donation to help us</b>.
                    There are many users who <a href="https://blog.freesound.org/?s=numbers" target="_blank">
                    regularly download content from Freesound</a>.
                    If many of us contribute, donating just a little bit will be enough to keep Freesound in good shape.
                    Ah, and if you donate you'll appear in this glorious <a href="{% url 'donors' %}">list of Freesound donors</a>.
