    The function will check if user's email is valid based on bounce info. The function will also check email
    preferences of recipients of the email. Parameters user_to and email_to are mutually exclusive, if one is set,
    other should be None.

    Args:
        subject (str): subject of the email.
        email_body (str): body of the email.
        user_to (Union[User, List[User]]): a User object or a list of User objects to send the email to. If user_to
            is set, email_to should be None.
        email_to (Union[str, List[str]]): a string representing an email address or a list of strings representing
            email addresses who to send the email to.  If email_to is set, user_to should be None.
        email_from (str): email string that shows up as sender. The default value is DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL in config.
        reply_to (str): email string that will be added as a "Reply-To" header to all mails being sent.
        email_type_preference_check (str): name of EmailPreferenceType that users should have enabled for the email to
            be sent. If set to None, no checks will be carried out.
        extra_subject (str): extra contents for the email subject which will be appended to the 'subject' param above
            and separated by a dash (this should be used to separate parts of the subject which are not common for a
            given type of email, e.g. to pass the "topic name" in a "topic reply notification" email).
