        Class that holds the results of a search query. It must contain the fields defined below.

        Args:
            docs (List[Dict]): list of dictionaries with the results of the query. Each dict object includes information
                about that individual result. That information is typically the ID of the matched object (Eg: the ID
                of a sound), but it can also include other properties. Here is a list of possible properties:
                - id (int): ID of the matched object (a sound or forum post). If results are grouped, this will be the ID of
                    the first matching result in the group
                - group_name (str): the name of the group. This includes the value of the grouping field shared by all
                    grouped results (only if grouping).
                - group_docs (List[Dict]): information about of results in the group. This is a list of dictionaries
                    with the data fields of the matched results (see examples below).  It can be that not all results
                    from the group are in this list (for example when grouping sounds by pack, we only want the first
                    sound result of the pack).
                - n_more_in_group (int): number of other matching results in the same group of the result (only
                    when grouping results). This number can be larger than the length of "group_docs" if the query
                    was configured to only return a limited number of results per group.
                Here is an example with IDs as the only property returned for each result:
                    docs = [{'id': 410650}, {'id': 412456}, {'id': 411506}, {'id': 411508}, {'id': 412404}, ...]
                Another example with extra properties returned for each result:
                    docs = [{
                        'id': 91368,
                        'post_body': 'Firstly, just want to say I absolutely love that...',

                    }, ... ]
                Another example for a sounds query with results grouped by pack:
                    docs = [
                        {'group_name': '410477', 'group_docs': [{'id': 410477}], 'id': 410477, 'n_more_in_group': 0},

                        ...
                    ]
                And another example for a forum posts query without grouping results:

                        'id': 91368,
