        Step 1) is used for the dynamic field names used in Solr (e.g. ac_tonality -> ac_tonality_s, ac_tempo ->
        ac_tempo_i). The dynamic field names we define in Solr schema are '*_b' (for bool), '*_d' (for float),
        '*_i' (for integer) and '*_s' (for string). At indexing time, we append these suffixes to the analyzer
        descriptor names that need to be indexed so Solr can treat the types properly. Now we automatically append the
        suffices to the filter names so users do not need to deal with that and Solr understands recognizes the field name.

            query_filter (str): query filter string.
