       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
       A "compressionMode" string element can be added to <codecFactory> to choose

           searcher to be opened to make those changes visible.

       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,
       which allows for alternate IndexReader implementations.

       ** Experimental Feature **

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent
       certain other features from working. The API to
       IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be
       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be
       resolved.


       ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a
       custom IndexReader implementation may cause incompatibility
       with ReplicationHandler and may cause replication to not work
       correctly. See SOLR-1366 for details.

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

    -->
  <requestDispatcher handleSelect="true" >
    <!-- Request Parsing

         These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
         those requests

         enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

         multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.

         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.

         addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
         the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
         object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the
         key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
         Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom
         plugins.

         *** WARNING ***
         Before enabling remote streaming, you should make sure your
         system has authentication enabled.

    <!-- HTTP Caching

         Set HTTP caching related parameters (for proxy caches and clients).

         The options below instruct Solr not to output any HTTP Caching
         related headers
      -->
    <httpCaching never304="true" />
    <!-- If you include a <cacheControl> directive, it will be used to
         generate a Cache-Control header (as well as an Expires header
         if the value contains "max-age=")

         By default, no Cache-Control header is generated.

         You can use the <cacheControl> option even if you have set
         never304="true"
      -->
    <!--
       <httpCaching never304="true" >
         <cacheControl>max-age=30, public</cacheControl>
       </httpCaching>
      -->
    <!-- To enable Solr to respond with automatically generated HTTP
         Caching headers, and to response to Cache Validation requests
         correctly, set the value of never304="false"

         This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
         headers based on the properties of the Index.

         The following options can also be specified to affect the
         values of these headers...

         lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
         Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
         requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
         was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

         (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
         the never304="true" option)
      -->
    <!--
       <httpCaching lastModifiedFrom="openTime"

  <!-- Request Handlers

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.

    -->
  <!-- SearchHandler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SearchHandler

       For processing Search Queries, the primary Request Handler
       provided with Solr is "SearchHandler" It delegates to a sequent
       of SearchComponents (see below) and supports distributed
       queries across multiple shards
    -->
  <requestHandler name="standard" class="solr.SearchHandler" default="true">
    <!-- default values for query parameters can be specified, these
         will be overridden by parameters in the request
      -->
    <lst name="defaults">
      <str name="echoParams">explicit</str>
      <!-- Default search field
         <str name="df">text</str> 
        -->
      <!-- Change from JSON to XML format (the default prior to Solr 7.0)
         <str name="wt">xml</str> 
        -->
    </lst>
    <!-- In addition to defaults, "appends" params can be specified
         to identify values which should be appended to the list of
         multi-val params from the query (or the existing "defaults").
      -->
    <!-- In this example, the param "fq=instock:true" would be appended to
         any query time fq params the user may specify, as a mechanism for
         partitioning the index, independent of any user selected filtering
         that may also be desired (perhaps as a result of faceted searching).

         NOTE: there is *absolutely* nothing a client can do to prevent these
         "appends" values from being used, so don't use this mechanism
         unless you are sure you always want it.
      -->
    <!--
       <lst name="appends">
         <str name="fq">inStock:true</str>
       </lst>
      -->
    <!-- "invariants" are a way of letting the Solr maintainer lock down
         the options available to Solr clients.  Any params values
         specified here are used regardless of what values may be specified
         in either the query, the "defaults", or the "appends" params.

         In this example, the facet.field and facet.query params would
         be fixed, limiting the facets clients can use.  Faceting is
         not turned on by default - but if the client does specify
         facet=true in the request, these are the only facets they
         will be able to see counts for; regardless of what other
         facet.field or facet.query params they may specify.

         NOTE: there is *absolutely* nothing a client can do to prevent these
         "invariants" values from being used, so don't use this mechanism
         unless you are sure you always want it.

  <!-- Search Components

       Search components are registered to SolrCore and used by
       instances of SearchHandler (which can access them by name)

       By default, the following components are available:

       <searchComponent name="query"     class="solr.QueryComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="facet"     class="solr.FacetComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="mlt"       class="solr.MoreLikeThisComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="highlight" class="solr.HighlightComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="stats"     class="solr.StatsComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="debug"     class="solr.DebugComponent" />

       Default configuration in a requestHandler would look like:

       <arr name="components">
         <str>query</str>
         <str>facet</str>
         <str>mlt</str>
         <str>highlight</str>
         <str>stats</str>
         <str>debug</str>
       </arr>

       If you register a searchComponent to one of the standard names,
       that will be used instead of the default.

       To insert components before or after the 'standard' components, use:

       <arr name="first-components">
         <str>myFirstComponentName</str>
       </arr>

       <arr name="last-components">
         <str>myLastComponentName</str>
       </arr>

       NOTE: The component registered with the name "debug" will
       always be executed after the "last-components"

     -->
</config>
